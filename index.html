    <h1><em>It is as if you were doing paperwork</em></h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to <em>It is as if you were doing paperwork</em>, a game of doing relentless amounts of paperwork to try to capture that illusive feeling of easy productivity. The game was developed as a part of the <a href="https://v-a-c.org/">VAC</a>'s <a href="https://v-a-c.org/en/ges2/festival-of-play-and-games-what-are-the-rules">"What Are the Rules?" festival</a> in Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the festival the game was presented alongside a truly elaborate office setup complete with staff to do employee intake, a person to play the boss, and even a water cooler, but below you'll find a paperwork generator along with some suggested equipment and approaches to playing the game.
    </p>

    <h2>Thoughts on play</h2>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>
      At a minimum to play this game you will need:
      <ol>
        <li>A pen</li>
        <li>An <strong>APPROVED</strong> stamp (or similar)</li>
        <li>A <strong>REJECTED</strong> stamp (or similar)</li>
        <li>An desk tray for ingoing and outgoing paperwork</li>
        <li>A wasterpaper basket</li>
        <li>A boss (who you can show paperwork to)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      You might also want to consider some "flavour" equipment like:

      <ol>
        <li>A desk</li>
        <li>One of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_eyeshade">green accountancy visors</a></li>
        <li>Some kind of <a href="https://freesound.org/people/dnlburnett/sounds/335711/">office environmental ambience</a></li>
        <li>At most two personal items for your desk</li>
        <li>A nearby water cooler</li>
        <li>An obnoxiously loud clock</li>
        <li>One more more co-workers</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Playing the game</h3>
    <p>
      After distributing sufficient paperwork to all workers, sit down and follow the instructions. Repeat until satisfied. If you run out of paperwork, you know where to come for more.
